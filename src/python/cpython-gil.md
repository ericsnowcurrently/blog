Caveat:  This reference is intended to be accurate.  I probably have some small
         details wrong but count on all the important things being correct.
         Feel free to leave a comment if you notice an error.

```
Caveat:  This reference is intended to be sufficiently complete, though not
         exhaustive (it isn't practical to try to cover every detail).  Where
         possible I'll point to other references that provide further detail.
         If you think I missed something then please leave a comment.
