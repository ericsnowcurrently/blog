This repo holds the various informational documents I've written.
It is effectively equivalent to blog posts I've written explaining
technical topics.

Feel free to open issues (e.g. for typos, errors, omissions) or even
pull requests.  Thanks!

TODO:
* pull in reference pages from blogger and bitbucket
* extract the common bits (e.g. footers)
* use ReST instead of markdown?
* render to GH pages or to my blog (e.g. blogger, ericsnowcurrently.github.io)?
* add tooling to render and publish?
